# Complexity Analysis

### Brute force soln
Time complexity: O(n^2).
For each element, we try to find its complement by looping through the rest of the array which takes O(n) time. Therefore, the time complexity is O(n^2).

Space complexity: O(1).
The space required does not depend on the size of the input array, so only constant space is used.
