# Data Structures & Algorithms Archives

Welcome to my personal collection of DSA solutions. This repository tracks my journey in mastering algorithms for systems engineering and problem-solving.

## Stats
| Platform | Solved | Focus Area |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LeetCode** | 0 | Arrays, Graphs, DP |
| **Gfg** | 0 | Basics |

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** C++ (Primary), Python (Secondary)
- **Topics:** Striver's A-Z Sheet

## Directory Structure
The repository is organized by **Patterns** rather than difficulty. This aligns with interview preparation strategies (recognizing the underlying pattern).

1. **Arrays & Hashing**: Basic maps, sets, and array manipulation.
2. **Two Pointers**: Optimization for sorted arrays.
3. **Sliding Window**: Subarray problems.
4. **Trees/Graphs**: DFS, BFS, and topological sorts.
